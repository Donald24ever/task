# Hi Andy, sorry for the delay. Had a really busy schedule. Attached to this file is the code although I encountered a bit of challenge with
my apache server which kept crashing down for some unknown reasons when trying to give each companies a dynamic link so they display the google maps
and address seperately. Apart from that the rest works. Modify.php displays the company details inserted into the database
index.php has the form insertion and the company2.php file was meant to display each companies inserted into the database.
